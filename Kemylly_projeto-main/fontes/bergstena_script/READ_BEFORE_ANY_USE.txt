Bergstena Script is a luxurious and decorative calligraphy font with a distinctively elegant attitude. The uppercase letters are finely sculpted with ornate loops and sweeping curves, capturing the essence of formal penmanship and ornamental signage from the past. Meanwhile, the lowercase set flows with smooth rhythm, retaining a soft, legible structure.

This typeface evokes the ambiance of handwritten wedding invitations or a personal letter. Each character feels carefully crafted, as if pulled from the nib of a master calligrapherâ€™s pen.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Designed and produced by Mans Greback, a type designer specializing in high-quality script fonts for over a decade. His work blends classic craftsmanship with modern font technology, resulting in timeless and versatile typefaces.
